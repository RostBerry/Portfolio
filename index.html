Currently knows 10 programming languages: Rust, C#, C++, C, Python, Java, Dart, Go, GLSL, HTML&CSS and 8 frameworks: Flutter, Bootstrap, Unity, Unreal Engine, javaGDX, pygame, OpenGL, SFML. There are rumors that some things such as ASM, LLVM and Arch Linux were written by non another than Rostislavs Berjoza back in the days. Although in recent 6 years his projects are not that impressive because now he has to write programms while deadlifting 3000kg with one hand and solving Rubik's cube with another simultaneously, he still has something impressive going on.</p>

                        <p class="text fs-4">Rostislavs has a long story with chess and chess programming in particular. It all began when he wanted to embrace the might of Python and test his skills by writing a chess bot that could conquer the lands of the Stockfish - the best chess bot on the planet at the moment. It took him 2 months to write just a game without the bot and to realize that his code was inefficient and contained lots of unfixable bugs, so he decided to rewrite it from scratch using a more standardized approach and more optimized techniques. He spent another couple of months and was very happy because of the drastic optimizations he did on the way. Eventually, he completed the game and even ran the first version of the bot, and it was so slow that scanning 2 moves deep into the position would take half a minute, and finally realized that Python is just a piece of garbage so he decided to rewrite it once again, using C#. From that point, Rostislavs accumulated all of the chess programming science with its most advanced techniques into his project and spent another 4 months making a blank engine without a bot, so scanning 2 moves deep into position would take the bot 1800 ns instead of 30 seconds. At first, it looked like a complete success, but if you remember, Rostislavs wanted to pair this bot with Stockfish in a death fight, and Stockfish could scan 2 moves deep into the position in 110 ns, it looked more like a RAM latency. It means that Rostislavs' bot was ~18x slower than Stockfish so he decided to rewrite it once again, into the final revision of the bot. You can tell he is desperate because now he has chosen to use Rust, which means a lot.</p>

                    <p class="text fs-4">Born on a snowy evening in a small farming town, he showed early signs of brilliance, earning the nickname "Little Genius" from his parents. His childhood was marked by an insatiable curiosity, and he quickly stood out in school for his technical prowess, creating a rudimentary computer network and impressively detailed technical sketches. Despite these achievements, he remained grounded and well-liked. His fascination with technology deepened in technical school, particularly when he discovered programming, leading to significant projects like a school management system and a popular game. However, his intense focus on programming eventually led to addiction, causing him to lose his family and struggle with personal demons. Hitting rock bottom, he chose to fight for recovery, seeking professional help and rebuilding his life with renewed purpose. He reconnected with his family, resumed his programming work with a social focus, launched a successful startup, and became an advocate for mental health and addiction recovery, demonstrating remarkable resilience and the potential for redemption.</p>
