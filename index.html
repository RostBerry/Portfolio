                        <p class="text fs-4">Rostislavs has a long story with chess and chess programming in particular. It all began when he wanted to embrace the might of Python and test his skills by writing a chess bot that could conquer the lands of the Stockfish - the best chess bot on the planet at the moment. It took him 2 months to write just a game without the bot and to realize that his code was inefficient and contained lots of unfixable bugs, so he decided to rewrite it from scratch using a more standardized approach and more optimized techniques. He spent another couple of months and was very happy because of the drastic optimizations he did on the way. Eventually, he completed the game and even ran the first version of the bot, and it was so slow that scanning 2 moves deep into the position would take half a minute, and finally realized that Python is just a piece of garbage so he decided to rewrite it once again, using C#. From that point, Rostislavs accumulated all of the chess programming science with its most advanced techniques into his project and spent another 4 months making a blank engine without a bot, so scanning 2 moves deep into position would take the bot 1800 ns instead of 30 seconds. At first, it looked like a complete success, but if you remember, Rostislavs wanted to pair this bot with Stockfish in a death fight, and Stockfish could scan 2 moves deep into the position in 110 ns, it looked more like a RAM latency. It means that Rostislavs' bot was ~18x slower than Stockfish so he decided to rewrite it once again, into the final revision of the bot. You can tell he is desperate because now he has chosen to use Rust, which means a lot.</p>

                        <p class="text fs-4">In order to aqcuire the new skill of writing programs in Rust, Rostislavs made a decision to make something simple to better understand basics of Rust before making another chess engine, so he started to write a Durak card game. The rules of the game are very simple yet hard to implement in a normal structured way in a program. Thus, the project took way much more time than Rostislavs expected and it got even worse because Rust isn't the easiest programming language out there, so Rostislavs couldn't understand if it was his fault in the game logic that player can't transfer his attack to another player or he miswrote some pointer in the Rust code and because of that anything wouldn't work. But despite all obstacles, the project is slowly but surely making its way to the finished state.</p>
                        <p class="text pt-3">At the moment, Rostislavs is very busy so he is not spending as much time on the project as he might want to but the project is still going on.</p>

                        <p class="text">He was born on a cold, snowy evening in a small town that was more known for its vast fields than for producing prodigies. From a young age, he exhibited a curiosity that set him apart from other children. His parents, humble farmers, marveled at how their son, who they affectionately called "Little Sigmis," seemed to absorb information like a sponge. While other children played with toy cars and action figures, he was more fascinated by the inner workings of these toys, often dismantling them to see how they functioned.
                            Growing up, his family life was simple but filled with love. His father, a hardworking man, spent long hours in the fields, while his mother tended to the house and garden. They encouraged his curiosity, providing him with books and tools to explore his interests. His early years were marked by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and he often spent hours reading about the stars, machinery, and anything that caught his fancy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text h3">School Achievements</p>
                    <p class="text">Entering school, it didn't take long for his teachers to notice that he was no ordinary student. His knack for understanding complex concepts and his innovative thinking soon made him the talk of the school. His most legendary feat was when he "created the Internet" as a school project. Of course, this wasn't the real Internet, but a rudimentary network that connected a few computers in the school library. He called it "Interlink," a playful nod to what the future held. His teachers were astounded, and the project earned him accolades and a reputation as the school's resident genius.
                        Another notable achievement was his drawing of an existing telephone. It wasn't just any drawing; it was a detailed, technical sketch that could have been mistaken for an engineer's blueprint. His attention to detail and understanding of the device's components left his classmates in awe and his teachers perplexed at how a child his age could possess such knowledge.
                        His fame in school wasn't limited to his technical prowess. His birthday coincided with the controversial reclassification of Pluto in 2006. He humorously claimed that the universe acknowledged his birthday by changing the status of a planet. This quirky claim added to his legendary status among his peers, who loved to share the story of how Pluto's fate was intertwined with his special day.
                        Despite his remarkable achievements, he remained a grounded and approachable boy. He participated in various school activities, from science fairs to sports, and built lasting friendships. His ability to balance his extraordinary talents with a down-to-earth personality made him beloved by teachers and students alike.</p>
                    <p class="text h3">Reflections on School Years</p>
                    <p class="text">Looking back on his school years, he often reflected on the unique path he had carved out for himself. His achievements were not just a result of his intelligence but also of the encouragement and support he received from his family and teachers. They nurtured his curiosity and provided him with the tools he needed to explore his interests.
                        His experiences in school laid the foundation for his technical inclinations. The projects he undertook, the challenges he faced, and the recognition he received all played a role in shaping his future. He realized early on that his passion lay in understanding and creating technology, a realization that would guide him through his technical school years and beyond.</p>
